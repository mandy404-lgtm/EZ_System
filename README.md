Z.AI: Intelligent SME Resilience
System
AI-Driven Decision Support for Small-to-Medium Enterprises
Flutter FastAPI MySQL ILMU AI (GLM-5.1)
Project Overview
Developed for UMHackathon 2026, Z.AI is a sophisticated decision-support tool
designed to empower SME owners. It bridges the gap between raw operational data
and strategic growth by utilizing the ILMU GLM-5.1 engine to provide real-time
inventory alerts, sales forecasting, and comprehensive CEO-level strategic reports.
# System Architecture
Frontend (UI Tier): Built with Flutter, featuring real-time state management,
interactive performance charts, and intuitive inventory controls.

Backend (Logic Tier): Powered by FastAPI, managing data orchestration,
prompt engineering for ILMU AI, and secure database transactions.
Data Tier (Persistence): A structured MySQL database designed for high
integrity, tracking products, sales trends, and AI-generated insights.
# Key Features
1. AI Business Intelligence
Utilizes the Integrity Shield logic to filter raw sales data and generate strategic
actions. Includes 30-day demand forecasting and trade-off analysis.
2. CEO Strategic Report
A global analysis module that synthesizes store-wide performance into an executive
summary, calculating a unique Financial Health Score (0-100) based on margins and
stock stability.
3. Dynamic Inventory Management
Real-time stock tracking with visual low-stock indicators and seamless
synchronization between mobile updates and the centralized database.
